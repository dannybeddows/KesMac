    <h1>look good ride good</h1>
    <span>Welcome to the start line for a new cycling brand with a different philosophy. Kesmac was born out of optimism and ambition that we can create an alternative to the ‘shrink it and pink it’ brigade. 
        We’re not against pink – but only pink? No thanks. This is why Kesmac exists. To provide clothing that is both bold in design and attributes. 
        No compromise on fashion for functionality. Look Good, Ride Good. That’s us.</span>
